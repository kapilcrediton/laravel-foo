## Post setup

Clone into local machine via `git`. Once you are set up:

- You should be able to run `composer install` from project root.
- You can run `php artisan serve` from the project root, open http://localhost:8000, and access laravel splash page.
- You should be able to run `php artisan migrate` to create tables in the db.
